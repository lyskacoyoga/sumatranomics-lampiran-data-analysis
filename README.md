This repository presents an analysis of Sumatra’s food supply chain (2010–2025), covering inflation volatility, price disparities, production efficiency, and the prospects of digital downstream integration.
In addition to datasets, this repository also provides Python code attachments for each analysis, including machine learning models, statistical processing, and visualization workflows.
The project is intended to support inclusive and sustainable economic policymaking in the food sector, while also serving as a reproducible resource for researchers, students, and practitioners.
